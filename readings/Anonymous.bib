This study contains a content analysis of a sample of newspapers to determine the frequency and nature of veiled attributions as they are now employed. The newspapers selected for this study were located in the East and Midwest. One of the major findings of the study was that 36 percent of the 5182 stories examined in this investigation contained at least one attribution.to unnamed sources. Additional findings of this study are reported in both narrative and table format.},
