# Anonymous Source Tracker

Tracks use of anonymous sources by select English-language media outlets.

## Weaknesses

- The tracker searches for commonly used phrases used to identify anonymous sources so misses anonymously sourced articles that do not use those phrases.
- Some matches are false and the article is not anonymously sourced.
- Some entries are duplicates because an article appeared on multiple news sites. These are typically from wire services.
- Some articles are duplicates because they have different urls but come from the same news site.
- Some articles refer to anonymous sources but are not themselves anonymously sourced.
- Articles that do not have a publication date in the Google search results or the URL are not included.
- The tracker does not distinguish between good use and misuse of anonymous sources.
