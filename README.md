
# Anonymous Source Tracker

Tracks use of anonymous sources by select English-language media outlets.

## Weaknesses

- Some articles are duplicates, typically from wire services, that appear on multiple websites.
- It searches for commonly used phrases used to identify anonymous sources so misses anonymously sourced articles that don't use those phrases.
- Some articles refer to anonymous sources but are not themselves anonymously sourced.
- It does not distinguish between good use and misuse of anonymous sources.
