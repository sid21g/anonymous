
# Anonymous Source Tracker

Tracks use of anonymous sources by select English-language media outlets.

## Weaknesses

- Some entries are duplicates because an article appeared on multiple news sites. These are typically from wire services.
- Some articles are duplicates because they use different urls but come from the same news site. 
- It searches for commonly used phrases used to identify anonymous sources so misses anonymously sourced articles that don't use those phrases.
- Some articles refer to anonymous sources but are not themselves anonymously sourced.
- It does not distinguish between good use and misuse of anonymous sources.
- The date listed is the date the article was scraped, not the publication date.
