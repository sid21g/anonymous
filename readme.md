This is the code for the [Anonymous Source Tracker](http://schaver.com/anonymous).

The Anonymous Source Tracker leverages [Google Custom Search](https://cse.google.com/) to find examples of anonymous sources used by media organizations popular in the United States. Every day it searches the top 50 online news outlets [as identified by the Pew Research Center in 2015](http://www.journalism.org/media-indicators/digital-top-50-online-news-entities-2015/) for [phrases commonly used to identify anonymous sources](https://github.com/markschaver/anonymous/blob/master/anonymous-phrases.txt). Examples are stored in [a SQLite database](https://github.com/markschaver/anonymous/blob/master/anon.db) and [a csv file](https://github.com/markschaver/anonymous/blob/master/anon.csv) that are available for download.

If you have questions or suggestions, [email me](mailto:mark.schaver@gmail.com).
