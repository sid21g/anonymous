The Anonymous Source Tracker, which used to be at http://schaver.com/anonymous/, leveraged [Google Custom Search](https://cse.google.com/) to find examples of anonymous sources used by online, English-language media organizations popular in the United States.  Every day it searched those news outlets for [phrases commonly used to identify anonymous sources](https://github.com/markschaver/anonymous/blob/master/anonymous-phrases.txt).  Examples were stored in [a SQLite database](https://github.com/markschaver/anonymous/blob/master/anon.db) and [a csv file](https://github.com/markschaver/anonymous/blob/master/anon.csv).
