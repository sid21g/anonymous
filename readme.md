This is the code for the [Anonymous Source Tracker](http://schaver.com/anonymous).

The Anonymous Source Tracker leverages [Google Custom Search](https://cse.google.com/) to find examples of anonymous sources used by media organizations popular in the United States.

Currently it searches the top 50 online news outlets [as identified by the Pew Research Center in 2015](http://www.journalism.org/media-indicators/digital-top-50-online-news-entities-2015/).

At least once a day the tracker searches the websites of these outlets for [phrases commonly used to identify anonymous sources](https://github.com/markschaver/anonymous/blob/master/anonymous-phrases.txt).

Examples are stored in a SQLite database that is [available for download](https://github.com/markschaver/anonymous/blob/master/anon.db). You can also download the data as [a csv file](https://github.com/markschaver/anonymous/blob/master/anon.csv)

If you have questions or suggestions, [email me](mailto:mark.schaver@gmail.com).
