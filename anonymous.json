One of them said Franken grabbed her butt while they posed for a photo at a women’s event in Minneapolis. The other woman said the senator “cupped her butt with his hand” at a Democratic fundraiser in 2008, according to HuffPost. “It’s difficult to respond to anonymous accusers, and I don’t remember those campaign events,” Franken said. Franken is already in the crosshairs of the Senate Ethics Committee after radio host Leeann Tweeden said the senator groped and forcibly kissed her. On Monday, another woman, Lindsay Menz, said Franken groped her while the pair took a photo at the Minnesota State Fair."

The “Queen Marie Antoinette’s Pearl,” with its diamonds and large, drop-shaped pearl, was one of 10 pieces of the ill-fated queen put up for sale at the Sotheby’s auction in Geneva. Some of the items up for sale had not been seen publicly for more than 200 years, having been stowed away in the Bourbon-Parma dynasty in Austria after Antoinette sent her most prized jewels to relatives in Austria for safekeeping. “This is about far more than the gems themselves: Marie Antoinette’s jewelry is inextricably linked to the cause of the French Revolution,” Eddie LeVian, CEO of jewelers Le Vian, said before the auction. Antoinette’s fondness for diamonds and jewels is believed to have played a major role in turning much of France against the monarchy and prompting the uprising that led to the queen’s execution by g"

One federal employee we spoke with, who asked to remain anonymous, said she has almost gone through all of her savings. “The whole money situation, once it gets to the end of the month, I think that's really when it's going to hit home for me,” she said. Unitus Credit Union said they have thousands of members just like her who are impacted by the government shutdown. Many of them live paycheck to paycheck, so money is tight right now. “We had a member come in to one of our branches and she shared her situation that she hasn't been paid since late December,” explained Unitus Credit Union Chief Operating Officer Jason Werts. As the shutdown reaches one month, several local credit unions like Unitus are offering help to federal employees. Unitus is waiving late fees, offering low interest loans, and delaying payments for people, among other things. The company said anyone can call them, even if they are not a member, and the",
