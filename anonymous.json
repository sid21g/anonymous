The other woman said the senator âcupped her butt with his handâ at a Democratic fundraiser in 2008, according to HuffPost. âItâs difficult to respond to anonymous accusers, and I donât remember those campaign events,â Franken said. Franken is already in the crosshairs of the Senate Ethics Committee after radio host Leeann Tweeden said the senator groped and forcibly kissed her. On Monday, another woman, Lindsay Menz, said Franken groped her while the pair took a photo at the Minnesota State Fair."

Some of the items up for sale had not been seen publicly for more than 200 years, having been stowed away in the Bourbon-Parma dynasty in Austria after Antoinette sent her most prized jewels to relatives in Austria for safekeeping. âThis is about far more than the gems themselves: Marie Antoinetteâs jewelry is inextricably linked to the cause of the French Revolution,â Eddie LeVian, CEO of jewelers Le Vian, said before the auction. Antoinetteâs fondness for diamonds and jewels is believed to have played a major role in turning much of France against the monarchy and prompting the uprising that led to the queenâs execution by g"
